            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Education has always been important to me. Coming from a migrant family of 12, my parents always instilled in us the need for what they called a "good" education. Learning the value of hard work as a young girl, I always knew I would pursue a higher education. It was not a question of if I would go to college, but where I would go to college. The lineage of 11 other siblings successfully entering universities and graduating with honors was a factor that drove me to want more. As I pursued a degree in business, I entered the world of k-12 education as a substitute teacher to help me financially. Little did I know that this would be the beginning a whole new career path.</p>
            <p>I decided to pursue this career and as they say, the rest was history.</p>
            <p>Today, I am proud to say that I come from a family of 12 that overcame financial hardships, had a strong work ethic, and a dream to do better for our families. We have all successfully graduated from a university and hold prestigious careers. </p>
            <p> I have two beautful daughters, Emma, 5, and Madision, 2, and a my husband is a deputy for Madera County. I work as a technology coach for Fresno Unified School District.</p>
